### Description: ###
The Program Counter (PC) points to the current instruction to execute.
It can increment its value (the normal usage) and can have a value loaded (through jumping).

The PC holds values from 0 to 13 (inclusive).
This is because the core can only hold 14 instructions (even though it is 4 bit and can have 16 instructions)

[Insert info on clamping]

Loading values and jumps:
When the PC is loaded with a value beyond the max index, the PC will be set to the last instruciton
in the memory.
When it is loaded with a negative value, it goes to the first instruction
